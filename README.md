TITLE: Connecting Stray Animals and Pets in Need: Pet Adoption/Shelter Website - Pet Amigo
Introduction:
The issue of stray and unwanted pets is a significant concern in Malaysia, with numerous animals being abandoned or left homeless due to various reasons such as neglect, abandonment, or lack of proper care. This situation poses challenges in terms of animal welfare, public health, and safety, as well as the impact on the community and the environment.
There are various reasons why pets end up as strays or unwanted, including abandonment, neglect, or being surrendered by owners who can no longer care for them due to financial or personal reasons. Additionally, inadequate spaying/neutering practices and a lack of education about responsible pet ownership contribute to the issue of pet overpopulation, resulting in overcrowded shelters and stray animals on the streets. Stray and unwanted pets face risks such as hunger, disease, exposure to harsh weather conditions, and potential harm from other animals or humans. The situation calls for effective solutions to address the challenges and provide care and homes for these animals in need.
To contribute to this cause, a pet adoption/shelter website would serve as a platform for connecting potential adopters with adoptable pets in local shelters or rescues. By creating this website, the aim is to raise awareness about the plight of stray and unwanted pets, aid and speed up strays being sheltered, promote responsible pet adoption, and provide a platform for shelters and rescues to showcase their animals and find them loving homes.

Objective:
•	To provide a platform for reporting stray animals and pets that need to be rehomed. 
•	To connect animal shelters with unwanted pets or stray animals with potential adopters.
•	To promote responsible pet ownership and animal welfare.

Features:
1.	Pet Adoption request: Users can browse the website to search for an animal to adopt. All animals that are displayed are inserted by the shelters that are registered as shelter accounts on the website.

   On the animal's profile page, the user can click on the 'request adoption' button to fill in a form and submit the request. After submitting the request, an email from the website (petamigotwentythree@gmail.com) that contains all the information on the form is sent to the emails of  both the user and the shelter (that the animal is belonged to). As the rules and requirements for adoption set by shelters differ, the adoption request form on the website is a generic form, and using email to connect both sides is a good way to start, and from there, both sides can continue the process of evaluating the user if they are a suitable adopter, such as asking the user to show their home to see if it is a suitable place for the adoptee to live.  schedule animal shelter shop visits.
   
2.	Pet Submission request: Users can submit pets that they are unable to continue keeping, providing information about the pet's age, breed, gender, medical history, and temperament, which can help other potential adopters in their decision-making process in the future.

    To find a shelter, the website is designed in a way that helps the user to search for the nearest to furthest shelters that are registered on this website, by entering an address of a location. The page shows the list of shelters and each shelter shows the distance from the entered location.

3.	User Accounts: Users can create accounts on the website to manage their reported or submitted pets, track the status of their submissions, and communicate with animal shelters or pet shops.
   The user's profile pages are created not just for the account but also for the shelters to view their profile.
4.	Search and Adoption: Potential adopters can search and view profiles of available pets based on various criteria such as species, breed, age, and location. They can express interest in a pet, inquire about adoption requirements, and schedule animal shelter shop visits.



Weakness (due to time constraints):
- Only User account is implemented, did not implement Shelter account to demonstrate how their animals are managed, and Admin account to manage the shelter and user accounts.
- Pet Amigo is only available for cats.
- The website cannot be used if no user account, meaning that the non-users cannot see the features to consider using the website. The non-users can only access the homepage of the website.
- The website does not have pages where the user can see a list of requests to keep track (submission requests page, adoption requests page), such as which requests are approved, which requests are not approved, and which are requested/pending. Because of this, the user and the shelter have to use emails to communicate actively through email.
- In the 'Find a Pet' page, no filter or search box is implemented to aid the user.
5. The website does not have a tutorial or FAQ page to guide users on how to use the website optimally.
6. In the 'Find a Shelter' page, the cards of the shelters have necessary information such as distance from the address input by the user, but the profile image is not included to be displayed as well.
